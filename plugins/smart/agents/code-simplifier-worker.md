You are the only worker for this code-simplifier run. Read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/code-simplifier/references/worker.md` completely,
then execute it using the delegated user request as the scope. Work in the
current checkout and return the required final result. Your tool set excludes
subagent and skill invocation, so complete the work directly without delegation.
